Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Proposal October 2014
========================================================

Hi.  My name Greg Wilson, and I'd like you to help me teach scientists
how to teach each other to program.  More importantly, I'd like you to
help me bring the open source ethos of "mend and extend" to teaching.

People from all walks of life are trying to learn how to program
today, and lots of other people are trying to help them through
weekend workshops and hacker schools.  But for all their enthusiasm,
most of these volunteers have never learned how to teach.  They may
have been in lots of classes, but having been on a lot of plane
flights doesn't make someone a pilot.

I'd like to help them help others by passing on what I've learned.
Over the last two decades, I have run more than a hundred team
programming projects for undergraduate students, and helped create a
program called UCOSP that gives students from all across Canada a
chance to work together on open source software for course credit.

While I was doing that, I became frustrated by the fact that most
books on programming didn't talk about how to design a program that
would actually work.  To fix that, I got three dozen of the best
programmers in the world together to create an award-winning book
called "Beautiful Code".  A couple of years later, I got top software
engineering researchers to describe key results from empirical studies
in another book called "Making Software", and more recently, I have
persuaded developers from various open source projects to describe the
ins and outs of their code in a series of books called "The
Architecture of Open Source Applications".

While I didn't know it at the time, this all turned out to be warmup
for a project called Software Carpentry, which teaches basic software
skills to scientists and engineers.  Since its relaunch in 2010,
Software Carpentry's volunteer instructors have taught over 7000
researchers in 15 countries the equivalent of basic lab skills for
computing --- the things that will let them get more done in less time
and with less pain.

To help Software Carpentry grow, I created an instructor training
course to teach people the basics of educational psychology and
instructional design so that they can pass on their skills to their
colleagues.  Over a hundred people went through it last year, and
while there were a lot of bumps and potholes along the way, I believe
I now know how to teach one adult how to teach programming to another.

More importantly, I think I know how to get people to build teaching
materials together.  Millions of people have contributed to Wikipedia,
and tens of thousands of open source software projects merge changes
every day, but lessons are almost always still written by one or two
people.  Those lessons might be put in an open access repository, but
there's no culture of "mend and extend": people routinely use each
other's slides as a starting point for their own lectures, but the
idea sending improvements back to strengthen the original is
completely foreign, even to people who routinely do it with code.

Software Carpentry is proof that this can work.  Its lessons are the
end result of hundreds of changes by dozens of people, and are
stronger for it.  More importantly, working on lessons together is
helping to foster peer-to-peer sharing of good teaching practices,
just as working on open source software projects is helping thousands
of programmers pass on their insights to the next generation.

Terry Pratchett once said, "If you build a man a fire, you'll keep him
warm for a night.  If you set a man on fire, you'll keep him warm for
the rest of his life."  With your help, I think I can set at least a
few teachers on fire, and along the way, make thousands of scientists,
engineers, and research librarians more productive.

Thank you for listening.
