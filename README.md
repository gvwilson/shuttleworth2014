Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Proposal October 2014
========================================================

Hi.  My name is Greg Wilson.  For the last sixteen years, I've been
teaching scientists how to use computers to do more research in less
time, and with less pain.  More recently, I've been teaching them how
to teach each other those skills.  I'd like you to help me do more of
that, but more importantly, to build tools and share practices that
will make the open source ethos of "mend and extend" normal in
education.

My starting point was the realization that giving the average
scientist a supercomputer is like giving a Ferrari to a teenager who
can barely get a family four-door out of the driveway.  Most
scientists are never actually taught how to program --- or how to test
code, or use version control, or any of the other things that
programmers do to make their lives easier.  As a result, they spend a
lot of time reinventing wheels, it takes them weeks or months to do
things they could in hours or days, and they have no idea when they're
finished whether their results are trustworthy, or even how to
reproduce them.

To fix this, I co-founded a project called Software Carpentry.  Its
aim is to teach scientists all the boring things that actually work,
like shell scripting, version control, and modular program
development.  Since 2010, it has grown into a volunteer organization
with more than 150 instructors in 19 countries.  In the last year
alone, we've run two-day workshops for over 7000 researchers, and
we're set to double those numbers in the coming two years.  And those
workshops are really making a difference.

There is now much more demand for workshops than we can meet, so for
the past two and a half years, I've been running a training course to
teach would-be instructors the basics of educational psychology,
instructional design, and what current research tells us about
teaching adults programming.  The course has been very popular --- we
have over 120 people signed up for the online version starting in
January 2015 --- but it has left me with a question: why don't we
create teaching materials the same way we write encyclopedias and
create software?

Millions of people have contributed to Wikipedia, and tens of
thousands of open source software projects merge changes every day,
but lessons are almost always still written by one or two people.
They might live in an open access repository, but there's no culture
of "mend and extend".  People routinely borrow PowerPoint slides they
find on the Internet, but they never send patches back to improve the
original.

Software Carpentry is proof that this can work.  Our lessons are the
end result of hundreds of changes by dozens of people, and are
stronger for it.  More importantly, working on lessons together is
helping to foster peer-to-peer sharing of good teaching practices,
just as working on open source software projects is helping thousands
of programmers pass on their insights to the next generation.

And most importantly of all, the teaching practices we're passing on
really are the right ones.  Four years ago, I finally started doing
what I should have done ages ago: read the literature on education and
learning.  I haven't been able to incorporate everything I've learned
into Software Carpentry --- not yet, anyway --- but we've done what we
can, and we're doing more all the time.

I'm really excited by these ideas, so I'd like to spend a year seeing
how far I can take them.  I want to see what it takes to get people to
build lessons the way the open source community builds software, and
whether doing that will encourage people to adopt modern,
evidence-based teaching practices, just as working on open software
has encouraged programmers to adopt things like code review and
continuous integration.

To do this, I want to expand Software Carpentry's instructor training
to produce two hundred new instructors a year --- instructors who can
and will create lessons collaboratively.  Those new instructors will
help us teach a lot of scientists, but in order to help them reach
even more people, I want to build some simple tools for writing and
managing lessons.  These tools will incorporate ideas from open source
like code review and discoverability --- ideas that are absent from
existing heavyweight approaches geared toward institutionalized
learning.  I want to build some new lessons using those tools, both to
try out the tools and because we need material on a wide variety of
subjects.  And finally, I want to record instructors in action and use
video annotation so that their peers can learn from them and give them
feedback, because I think that will be the most effective way to
spread good practices around.

[cut to Gabriel Devenyi talking about his growth as an instructor]

I think I'm the right person to do this because Software Carpentry
isn't the only collaborative project I've gotten off the ground.  In
the early 2000s, I started running project courses for senior
undergrads at the University of Toronto.  By 2009, I had turned that
into a program called UCOSP, in which students from universities all
across Canada work in distributed teams on open source projects.  In
2006, I brought together three dozen of the best programmers in the
world to create an award-winning book called "Beautiful Code".  A
couple of years later, I persuaded top researchers in software
engineering to describe key results from empirical studies of how
people actually program in another book called "Making Software", and
more recently, I've been managing a series of books called "The
Architecture of Open Source Applications", in which the lead designers
of major open source projects describe how their programs are put
together.

[cut to Marian Petre talking about marrying research with practice]

Terry Pratchett once said, "If you build a man a fire, you'll keep him
warm for a night.  If you set a man on fire, you'll keep him warm for
the rest of his life."  With your help, I think I can set thousands of
scientists on fire, and by doing so, figure out how to bring open
collaboration to a whole new audience.  I hope you are as excited by
this as I am --- thank you for listening.
