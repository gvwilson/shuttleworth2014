Questions and Answers from the Application Form
===============================================

1. Describe the world as it is. (A description of the status quo and
   context in which you will be working, max 1500 ch)

Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using
software. However, most of them are never actually taught how to do
this - they pick up bits and pieces by osmosis and good luck. As a
result, it takes them weeks or months to do things they could in hours
or days, and when they're done, they often don't know how trustworthy
their results are, how to reproduce them, or how to share them.

And there's something else scientists don't share: their lessons and
how they teach them.  Millions of people have contributed to
Wikipedia, and tens of thousands will submit patches to open source
software projects today alone, but even open educational resources are
almost always still written by one or two people.  People routinely
"borrow" PowerPoint slides they find on the Internet, but even those
who contribute to Wikipedia and open source almost never send patches
back to improve the original.  The "mend and extend" ethos that is the
basis of truly open collaboration simply isn't part of how most people
think about teaching.

2. What change do you want to make?  (A description of what you want
   to change about the status quo, in the world, your personal vision
   for this area, max 1500 ch)

I want every scientist to learn the equivalent of basic lab skills for
scientific computing, but that is just a step toward a larger goal.
What I really want is for massive, open collaboration to be a normal
part of scientists' lives.  Software Carpentry is giving them some of
the skills they need to do that in their research; the next step is to
see if we can do it in their teaching.

I believe that if we can make open collaboration the new normal, it
will encourage scientists (and others) to adopt modern evidence-based
teaching techniques as well, just as the spread of open software
development in the 1990s and early 2000s led to broader uptake of
practices like code review, which in turn allowed programmers to learn
better technique from one another.  I think the same can happen with
teaching once people are used to working out in the open, and that
we'll all be better off for it.

3. What do you want to explore?  (Describe the innovations or
   questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year, max
   1500 ch)

I want to try using off-the-shelf package managers to manage teaching
materials, so that "lesson install calculus-trig-derivatives" will get
the lesson, the code and data it uses, and whatever it depends on.
Once this is in place, I then want to build an aggregator - a "CPAN
for lessons" that will encourage people to mend and share rather than
just upload and download.

(I also believe that if we can make this work, we could use it to
"install" scientific papers for reading, review, and re-analysis,
which would be an interesting new approach to the scientific
reproducibility crisis.)

But this is just a means to an end.  Open education shouldn't mean "I
can use your slides", but rather, "We can all work together to make
those slides (and exercises, and videos) better for everyone."  The
technical tools for doing this have been around for years; I think
they can help educators just as much as they've helped programmers,
but somebody has to get the ball rolling.

And if people start collaborating on material, they'll be more likely
to share good practices with each other.  Educational researchers know
a lot about teaching and learning that isn't yet part of mainstream
practice; equally, a lot of good ideas are stuck in the classroom of
the teacher who invented them because there's no way for her to share
them.  I think open collaboration could help us fix both problems at
once.

4. What are you going to do to get there?  (A description of what you
   actually plan to do during the year, max 1500 ch)

a) I will train at least 200 new Software Carpentry instructors during
   the course of the first year of this fellowship, both as a good in
   its own right, and to create a pool of people willing and able to
   try the ideas described below.

b) I will build prototypes in order to experiment with ways of using
   and extending open version control repositories and package
   managers to collaborate on, distribute, and remix teaching
   materials.

c) I will create a short course on evidence-based best practices in
   teaching and learning (tentatively titled "What Everyone in Science
   and Technology Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Education"),
   and make it freely available under the Creative Commons -
   Attribution license.

5. Does your idea/project have a name?

Yes

   Project/Idea Name

6. How does your idea relate to openness?

Matthew Crawford once wrote, "Too often, the defenders of free markets
forget that what we really want is free men."  Similarly, I think that
many advocates of open science, open data, and open source development
sometimes forget that they just a means to an end.  The real goal is
to allow everyone, everywhere, to work together without hindrance.
Openness is necessary for that, but not sufficient: people must have
the skills to actually do it in order for it to be meaningful.

Software Carpentry fosters openness by giving people what they need to
be open.  And by explaining the ideas behind those tools, it helps
people understand why and how open is better.  Once these ideas take
hold, and once people see that they apply not just to research but
also to teaching, I believe they will find ways to apply them in
domains we haven't thought of and ways we can't yet imagine.

7. Have you started implementation of the idea?

Yes

   If so, please provide details on organisational structure, life
   cycle and progress (max 1500 ch)

Software Carpentry ran its first class at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in 1998.  Since 2010, it has grown into a volunteer
organization with over 165 instructors in 19 countries, who have
taught more than 100 two-day workshops for more than 5000 people in
the last year alone.  In October 2014, we set up a non-profit Software
Carpentry Foundation (see
http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/10/announcing-the-creation-of-the-software-carpentry-foundational.html).
Its interim board is currently drafting bylaws for review, and will
replace itself with a permanent board early in 2015.

As well as running workshops, Software Carpentry also runs an
instructor training course to teach scientists (many of them workshop
alumni) the basics of educational psychology and instructional design,
and how to apply ideas from both to teach other scientists how to
program.  More than 60 people are currently taking part in the
eleventh online offering of this training, and we are now also
offering intensive two- and three-day compressed versions on site in
Europe, North America, and Australia.

Software Carpentry's teaching materials are all freely available under
the Creative Commons - Attribution license.  They are hosted on
GitHub, and are proof that open collaboration on lessons can work: the
most recent versions have had over a hundred contributors in the last
two years.

8. How have you funded your initiative in the past?

Other

   Funding Details (max 1500 ch)

Software Carpentry has been supported by a wide range of organizations
over the years, from universities and national laboratories through
philanthropic foundations and private companies - please see
http://software-carpentry.org/pages/sponsors.html for a complete list.

Since January 2012, Software Carpentry has used a hybrid funding
model: workshop hosts (typically universities) cover the travel and
accommodation costs of instructors, but central costs (such as
curriculum development and instructor training) are covered from
grants and donations.  This has allowed us to scale our workshops to
the point where instructor training is now our biggest bottleneck.

9. Who are your current or potential key partners?

Our interim board includes representatives from the Sloan Foundation,
the Mozilla Science Lab, the Software Sustainability Institute,
ELIXIR-UK, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  We are in
discussion and/or preparing proposals for the Moore Foundation, the
Arnold Foundation, and the NIH, and are seeking donations to support
workshops specifically for women in science and engineering from
Rackspace, Red Hat, Waterfront International, and Insight Data
Science.
