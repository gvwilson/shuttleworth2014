Questions and Answers from the Application Form
===============================================

1. Describe the world as it is. (A description of the status quo and
   context in which you will be working, max 1500 ch)

Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using
software. However, most of them are never actually taught how to do
this --- they pick up bits and pieces by osmosis and good luck. As a
result, they spend a lot of time reinventing wheels, it takes them
weeks or months to do things they could in hours or days, they often
have no idea whether their results are trustworthy, or even how to
reproduce them, and they can't share their software because they lack
the skills and the software itself isn't in a shareable state.

Software isn't the only thing they don't share.  Millions of people
have contributed to Wikipedia, and to tens of thousands of open source
software projects, but lessons are almost always still written by one
or two people.  While people routinely "borrow" PowerPoint slides they
find on the Internet, they almost never send patches back to improve
the original.  They might put their lessons in an open access
repository, but the "mend and extend" ethos that is the basis of truly
open collaboration simply isn't part of most educators' thinking.

2. What change do you want to make?  (A description of what you want
   to change about the status quo, in the world, your personal vision
   for this area, max 1500 ch)

I want every scientist to learn the equivalent of basic lab skills for
scientific computing.  I don't want them all to become professional
software engineers; instead, I want them to be able to do routine
things on their own, and to be able to collaborate effectively with
professional developers when they need to.

But I don't just want scientists to be able to compute better --- I
want them to be able to *collaborate* better.  The scientists I meet
today no longer ask, "Why should I be open?" but rather, "How do I
actually do that?"  And once they know why and how to collaborate out
in the open, I want them to do that in their teaching, not just in
their science, because I think that openness in one area accelerates
and reinforces openness in others.

Finally, I don't just want scientists to share what they have: I want
them to *improve* it.  Code review was talked about more often than it
was done until globally distributed collaboration on open source came
along.  Equally, I think that peer review and improvement of teaching
materials and good teaching practices are bound to take off once
people are used to working out in the open.

3. What do you want to explore?  (Describe the innovations or
   questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year, max
   1500 ch)

I want to keep teaching scientists core software development skills,
and the thinking behind those skills, so that they can do more
research in less time, and with less pain.  While doing that, I want
to teach some of them how to teach these things themselves, so that
they can pass on what they've learned to their colleagues.

In doing this, I want to show scientists that all these same ideas can
be applied to creating, sharing, and maintaining teaching materials.
Open education shouldn't mean "I can use your slides", but rather, "We
can all work together to make those slides (and exercises, and videos)
better for everyone."  The technical and social tools for doing this,
like version control and code review, have been around for years; I
think they can help educators just as much as they've helped
programmers, but somebody has to get the ball rolling.

Finally, I think that if people start collaborating on material,
they'll be more likely to share good practices with each other, just
as programmers who collaborate on open source projects pick up good
practices like test-driven development.  Educational researchers know
a lot about teaching and learning that isn't yet part of mainstream
practice; equally, a lot of good ideas are stuck in the classroom of
the teacher who invented them because there's no way for her to share
them.  I think open collaboration could help us fix both problems at
once.

4. What are you going to do to get there?  (A description of what you
   actually plan to do during the year, max 1500 ch)

a) I will greatly reduce the number of Software Carpentry workshops I
   personally teach, and focus instead on training Software Carpentry
   instructors.  More specifically, I will train at least 200 new
   instructors during the course of the first year of this fellowship.

b) I will lead work within the Software Carpentry community to improve
   tooling for open collaboration on teaching materials.  This will
   include development of human-editable but machine-readable
   templates for lessons, tools for checking the consistency and
   prerequisites of lessons based on their definitions of key concepts,
   and training materials to show people who *aren't* programmers how
   to use open source techniques (such as incremental patching and
   threaded review) to collaborate on lesson development.

c) I will (finally) write a 30,000-word guide to evidence-based best
   practices in teaching and learning titled, "What Everyone in
   Science and Technology Absolutely, Positively Must Know About
   Education (No Exceptions)", and make it freely available under the
   Creative Commons - Attribution license.

5. Does your idea/project have a name?

Yes

   Project/Idea Name

Software Carpentry

6. How does your idea relate to openness?

Matthew Crawford once wrote, "Too often, the defenders of free markets
forget that what we really want is free men."  Similarly, I think that
many advocates of open science data sometimes forget that it is just a
means to an end.  The real goal is to allow everyone, everwhere, to
work together without hindrance.  Openness is necessary for that, but
not sufficient: people must have the skills to actually *do* open for
it to be meaningful.  Once they have those skills, and see that they
can be applied in teaching as well as research, I believe they will
start applying them in other domains as well, and in ways that we
cannot yet imagine.

7. Have you started implementation of the idea?

Yes

   If so, please provide details on organisational structure, life
   cycle and progress (max 1500 ch)

Software Carpentry ran its first class at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in 1998.  Since its reboot in 2010, it has grown into a
volunteer organization with over 165 instructors in 19 countries, who
have taught more than 100 two-day workshops for more than 5000 people
in the last year alone.  In October 2014, we began work to set it up
as an independent non-profit foundation through which its volunteer
instructors and organizational stakeholders could set its future
course.

As well as running workshops, Software Carpentry also runs an
instructor training course to teach scientists (many of them workshop
alumni) the basics of educational psychology and instructional design,
and how to apply ideas from both to teach other scientists how to
program.  More than 60 people are currently taking part in the
eleventh online offering of this training, and we are now also
offering intensive two- and three-day compressed versions on site in
Europe, North America, and Australia.

Software Carpentry's teaching materials are all freely available under
the Creative Commons - Attribution license.  They are hosted on
GitHub, and are proof that open collaboration on lessons can work: the
most recent versions have had over a hundred contributors in the last
two years.

8. How have you funded your initiative in the past?

Other

   Funding Details (max 1500 ch)

Software Carpentry has been supported by a wide range of organizations
over the year, from universities and national laboratories through
philanthropic foundations and private companies --- please see
http://software-carpentry.org/pages/sponsors.html for a complete
list.

Since January 2012, Software Carpentry has used a hybrid funding model
in which workshop hosts (typically universities) cover the travel and
accommodation costs of instructors, but central costs (such as
curriculum development and instructor training) are covered from
grants and donations.  This has allowed us to scale our workshops to
the point where instructor training is now our biggest bottleneck.
