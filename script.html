<p>Hi. I'm Greg Wilson. For the last sixteen years, I've been teaching scientists how to use computers to do more research in less time, and with less pain. I'd like to do more of that, but with your help, I'd also see if we can bring the open source ethos of &quot;mend and extend&quot; to education.</p>
<p>Most scientists are never actually taught how to program. They pick up bits and pieces as they go along, so most of them never run into ideas like version control, unit testing, and continuous integration.</p>
<p>As a result, when they think they're done, they often can't reproduce their results, they may not even know how they produced those results in the first place, they can't share them with other people, and they don't know how trustworthy they are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dominique Vuvan:</p>
<p>At the beginning of grad school, my supervisor said, &quot;OK, you're going to have to learn how to program in MATLAB.&quot; He gave me a book and one piece of example code and sent me off. I ended up struggling for years trying to attain basic competency I had no idea how to create functions to avoid copy-pasting hundreds of lines, no idea how to comment my code so that I'd understand it later, no idea how to use version control to keep track of all the changes that I'd made and share my code effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To fix this, I co-founded a volunteer organization called Software Carpentry. Since January 2010, we've run over 220 events for more than 7500 people in 19 countries, and now have more than 165 qualified instructors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adina Chuang Howe:</p>
<p>In 2010, as a postdoc, I enrolled in a Software Carpentry workshop to learn how to use computational tools for my research. A year later, I found myself not only using what I learned for my research but also teaching workshops to other biologists struggling with their data. This January, I'm happy to say I'll be joining Iowa State University as their presidential big data faculty hire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is much more demand for workshops than we can meet right now, so for the past two and a half years, I've been running an instructor training program in which we introduce people to basic ideas from educational psychology and instructional design. The run that starts in January has more than 120 people signed up, and more than half that number are already waitlisted for the run that starts in May.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin Ely:</p>
<p>What has been striking about Software Carpentry is how universal it is. Researchers in every discipline benefit from the things we teach. As an instructor, I've worked with people from astronomy, physics, biology, mathematics, economics, and computer science. They all came together because they recognized the need to spread this knowledge within their own field, and Software Carpentry helped them do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But all of this has left me with a question. Millions of people have edited Wikipedia articles; today alone, tens of thousands of programmers will contribute to open source software projects. Why don't we build lessons that way? I've never seen a lesson with more than half a dozen authors --- even open educational resources are usually written by the few to be consumed by the many --- there's simply no culture of fork, modify, review, and merge in education.</p>
<p>Software Carpentry is proof that this can work. Our lessons are the results of hundreds of changes made by dozens of people. And perhaps what's more important is, as they're contributing to the project, they're learning better teaching techniques from each other, just as programmers who contribute to open source and go through code review learn better coding style.</p>
<p>I'm really excited by this, so I'd like to see how far we can take it. I' like to expand the instructor training program, and I'd like to build some tools to see if we can use off-the-shelf package managers to manage lessons so that we can build something like CPAN or CRAN for teaching materials. But most importantly, I want to see if by doing this we can actually get better evidence-based teaching methods into the hands of thousands or tens of thousands of teachers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon Udell:</p>
<p>Open source software developers live in the future. They collaborate on a global network using tools and methods than enable continuous improvement and that yield reproducible results. Software Carpentry's mission isn't only to help scientists become better programmers and custodians of data. It also aims to lead scientists into their near future of open collaboration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I can do this because Software Carpentry isn't the first project I've got off the ground. In 2006, I got dozen of the world's best programmers to collaborate on a book called &quot;Beautiful Code&quot;, which won the Jolt Award in 2008. In 2009, I helped launch a project called UCOSP which gives undergraduate students in computer science from all across Canada a chance to work on real open source software projects in distributed teams for credit.</p>
<p>I got software engineering researchers to work on a book called &quot;Making Software&quot;, in which they explain what we actually know about how people program, and why we believe it's true. And throughout all of that, I've been editing a series of books called &quot;The Architecture of Open Source Applications&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marian Petre:</p>
<p>Greg Wilson has a singular ability to connect different forms of knowing. He does this in his own thinking, he does this through his networking. He puts theorists in touch with empiricists, he puts researchers in touch with practitioners, he puts experts in touch with people who have problems to solve... And then he helps to shape and motivate their collaboration in order to produce something useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open science and open data are important, but they're just enablers. The real revolution is massive, open collaboration. I think I can bring some of that to education. I hope you'll be as excited by that as I am - thank you for listening.</p>
