Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Proposal October 2014
========================================================

Hi.  I'm Greg Wilson.  For the last sixteen years, I've been teaching
scientists how to use computers to do more research in less time, and
with less pain.  With your help, I'd like to do even more of that, but
also see if we can bring the open source ethos of "mend and extend" to
education.

Most scientists are never actually taught how to program.  They pick
up odds and ends piecemeal, and as a result, they never run into ideas
like version control, unit testing, and continuous integration.

As a result, it takes them days or weeks to do things that could be
done in minutes or hours.  When they're finished, they often have no
idea how to reproduce their results, how trustworthy those results
are, or how to share their work with other people.

To fix this, I co-founded a volunteer organization called Software
Carpentry.  We teach scientists things like shell scripting, version
control, and modular program development, but what we're really
teaching is how to automate repetitive tasks, how to track and share
work, and how to build something you can read, test, and re-use.
Since January 2010, we've run over 200 events for over 7500 people in
19 countries, and now have over 160 qualified instructors.

There is much more demand for workshops than we can meet, so for the
past two and a half years, I've been running an instructor training
course to teach people the basics of educational psychology and
instructional design.  120 people are already signed up for the next
run, and half that number are waitlisted for the one after that.

But all this has left me with a question.  Millions of people have
contributed to Wikipedia; today alone, and tens of thousands of
programmers will submit patches to open source software projects, but
it's rare to find a lesson with more than half a dozen authors.  Even
so-called open educational resources are usually written by a very
small number of people --- forking, sending a patch for review, and
merging simply isn't part of the culture of teaching.

Software Carpentry is proof that this can work.  Our lessons are the
end result of hundreds of changes by dozens of people.  What's more,
those people are learning about teaching from each other as they
contribute, just as programmers learn from each other by doing code
reviews.

I'm really excited by what we've been doing, so I'd like to see how
far we can take it.  I want to expand the instructor training program,
and see whether we can use off-the-shelf package managers to
distribute and manage lessons so that we can create something like
CPAN or PyPI for teaching, and then install lessons, code, and data
the way we install software.

All of this will let me see if we can get people to collaborate on
building teaching materials and sharing their teaching practices so
that they can help each other improve.

I think I can do this because Software Carpentry isn't the first
collaborative project I've gotten off the ground.  In 2006, I brought
together three dozen of the best programmers in the world to create an
award-winning book called "Beautiful Code".  In 2009, I started a
program called UCOSP that brings together undergraduate CS students
from all over Canada to work in teams on open source projects for
course credit.

The year after that, I got top software engineering researchers to
describe what we actually know about how people program in another
book called "Making Software".  More recently, I've been editing a
series of books called "The Architecture of Open Source Applications".

Open science and open data are important, but they're just enablers.
Better skills are just an enabler too.  The *real* revolution is open,
massive collaboration.  I think I can bring that to a whole new
audience.  I hope you are as excited by that as I am --- thank you for
listening.
